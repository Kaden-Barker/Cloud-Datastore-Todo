# Full Stack Todo App
Basic Todo App that uses Create React app

# Client Side
The client side has been written in javascript. It implements functions for basic html features of a todo add. Uses states and hooks to set and hold data that should be displayed. Functions make calls to the server side code to store Todo items

# Server Side
The server side has also been written in javascript. I used google cloud to store todo items in a non relational database called google datastore. In the serverside calls are made to get and remove data based on requests from the client. 

# Running Locally
Requires two terminals
In server directory run node server.js
In frontend directory run npm start
